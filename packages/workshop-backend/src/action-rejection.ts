 * activity views repaint without further plumbing.
 *
 * The caller validates that `record` is pending before calling, and is responsible for resolving
 * the restart target (this core never sees callers or facet naming) -- pass `restartGadget` only
 * when the primary action's caller is a gadget. Note the restart targets only the PRIMARY
 * action's calling gadget: cascaded records submitted by a different gadget on the same
 * gatekeeper are not restarted (rare; such a gadget re-observes real state on its next run).
 *
 * Cascaded records do NOT resume suspended agent turns: a rejected awaited record leaves the
 * turn ended, same as a direct rejection.
 *
 * Concurrency notes:
 * - A concurrent double-reject is benign: the second gatekeeper call no-ops on the
 *   already-deleted action and returns an empty cascade, and the re-get below skips the
 *   already-rejected record. No single-flight guard is needed.
 * - Cascade vs. a concurrent auto-approval drain is sound in either order: the gatekeeper DO's
 *   input gate serializes its apply/reject handlers, the drainer catches "Unknown action" and
 *   stops, and both sides re-get records before mutating.
